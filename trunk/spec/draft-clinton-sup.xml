    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>
	SUP (Simple Update Protocol) consists of a notification format
	that feed publishers can use to alert consumers that one or
	more content feeds have been recently updated. The presence of
	a SUP feed allows for increased efficiency, and decreased
	latency, by reducing or eliminating the need for consumers to
	frequently poll each underlying feed individually.
      </t>

      <section title="Notational Conventions">

	<t>
	  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
	  "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
	  and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
	  described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
	</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Design Considerations">
	<t>
	  SUP feeds are designed to be easy for publishers to create,
          increasing in benefit as the number of underlying feeds
          grows.  Consumers that read a large number of feeds from a
          given publisher, such as a blog aggregators, hosted feed
          readers, or intermediary publishers, will similarly benefit
          most from using the SUP feed to reduce polling rates for
          individual feeds and query only when updates are available.
	</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>
	Publishers that produce large numbers of content feeds can
	aggregate a list of feeds that have changed over a given time
	period and publish this list as a <xref target="sup-feed">SUP
	Feed</xref> to consumers.  Each underlying content feed is
	identified by an opaque token called
	a <xref target="sup-id">SUP ID</xref>, which consumers can
	associate with a previously-seen feed URL, which can then be
	re-queried as necessary.  Publishers use
	the <xref target="x-sup-id">X-SUP-ID HTTP header</xref> and
	the
	<xref target="sup-link">atom:link element</xref> with each
	content feed to announce the feed's unique SUP ID and the
	location of the SUP feed itself.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sup-feed" title="SUP Feed">

      <t>
	[Ed: Perhaps consider changing the name of this to 'Updates
	Feed' to reduce redundancy.  Also, "feed" itself might be a
	misleading term, as each new version tends to overwrite the
	last completely.  Perhaps "Updates Document" is better?]
      </t>

      <t>
	A SUP feed consists of a document of type 'application/json'
	containing a single top-level
	<xref target="RFC4627">JSON Object</xref>, mapping a set
	of well-known keys to well-defined values, as defined
	below.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	Consumers SHOULD ignore any unanticipated keys in the JSON
	document and continue to parse the expected values as
	intended.
      </t>

      <t>
	The overall structure of the SUP feed is as follows:

    <section anchor="sup-id" title="SUP ID">

      <t>
	[Ed: Perhaps consider changing this to 'Resource Id' to reduce
	redundancy.  And more generally, consider calling the
	underlying documents "resources" rather than "feeds", as the
	SUP technique isn't specific to only Atom or RSS content.]
      </t>

      <t>
	A SUP ID is a short opaque string used to identify a
	individual content feed.  A single feed MUST always map to a
	single, stable SUP ID, but different feeds MAY occasionally
	share the same SUP ID.
      </t>

      <t>
	Consumers SHOULD NOT attempt to parse or interpret the
	contents of the string, but instead should maintain their own
	mapping of SUP IDs to resource URIs.  The mapping of SUP ID to
	resource URI is established via
	the <xref target="discovery">Discovery</xref> mechanisms
	defined below.
      </t>

      <t>
	A valid SUP ID is a non-empty string of no more than 128
	characters composed of ASCII letters, numbers, or hyphens
	(regex [a-zA-Z0-9-]), and are produced via the following
	rules, as defined by the
	<xref target="RFC5234">augmented BNF</xref> syntax.

      <t>
	The Update ID is a short opaque string used to disambiguate
	distinct updates to a content feed.  In practice, the last
	update timestamp of the content feed is a suitable identifier,
	but clients SHOULD NOT attempt to parse or intepret the
	contents of the string.

      <t>
	This section discusses how a publisher signals the existence
	of SUP feed.

	Feeds SHOULD announce the availabilty of by setting the
	<xref target="x-sup-id">'X-SUP-ID' HTTP header</xref>, and/or
	by including a <xref target="sup-link">'atom:link'
	element</xref>, or both.
      </t>

      <t>
	Use of the 'X-SUP-ID' HTTP header is RECOMMENDED since it
	works for feed types, but feed consumers SHOULD be prepared
	for the presence of the link element in addition to, or
	instead of, the X-SUP-ID header.
      </t>

      <section anchor="x-sup-id" title="'X-SUP-ID' HTTP header">

	<t>
	  Responses to <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP</xref> requests for
	  content feeds SHOULD include a <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP
	  Response Header</xref> of 'X-SUP-ID' to signal both the URI
	  at which the <xref target="sup-feed">SUP feed</xref> may be
	  polled and the <xref target="sup-id">SUP ID</xref> of the
	  underlying content feed.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Valid 'X-SUP-ID' headers are produced via the following
	  rules, as defined by the
	  <xref target="RFC5234">augmented BNF</xref> syntax, the URI

	<t>
	  For example, the following 'X-SUP-ID' header refers to a SUP

	  'atom:link' element to signal both the URI at which
	  the <xref target="sup-feed">SUP feed</xref> may be polled
