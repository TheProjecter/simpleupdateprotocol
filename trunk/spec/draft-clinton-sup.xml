    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>
	SUP (Simple Update Protocol) consists of a notification format
	called an <xref target="updates-document">Updates
	Document</xref> that content publishers can use to alert
	consumers that one or more resources have been recently
	changed.  Clients can subsequently poll a single Updates
	Document rather than each underlying resource individually and
	thus decrease both the latency in discovering recent changes
	and the total amount of bandwidth and time consumed.
      </t>

      <section title="Notational Conventions">

	<t>
	  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
	  "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
	  and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
	  described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
	</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Design Considerations">
	<t>
	  Updates Documents are designed to be easy for publishers to
          create, and increase in benefit as the number of underlying
          resources and the number of consumers grow.  Similarly,
          consumers that poll for a large number of resources from a
          given publisher, such as blog aggregators, feed readers,
          or intermediary publishers, will benefit from polling a
          publisher's Updates Document before retrieving each
          underlying resource individually.

    <section title="Overview">
      <t>
	Publishers of URI-addressable resources may associated a
	semi-unique opaque identifier, called
	a <xref target="resource-token">Resource Token</xref>, with
	each underlying resource.  The publisher signals the existence
	of these Resource Tokens via a discovery mechanism during the
	retrieval of the resource, either within the resource itself
	(the <xref target="updates-link-element">Updates Link
	Element</xref>) or as meta-data associated with the response
	(the <xref target="updates-link-header">Updates Link
	Header</xref>).  The publisher may then create a
	URI-addressable <xref target="updates-document">Updates
	Document</xref> that informs consumers which resources, as
	identified by Resource Tokens, have been recently modified.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        SUP does not require that a site MUST encrypt its resource
        tokens. The resource tokens may be rendered opaque through
        strong encryption, hashing, or they may be non-opaque. In a
        scenario where a SUP document is being used to indicate that
        private or password protected resources have been updated and
        the resource tokens are insufficiently opaque (e.g. the urls
        of the resources are used as resource tokens or the resource
        tokens are rendered opaque with an algorithm that can be
        reversed in order to identify the underlying resource) then an
        attacker can build up a detailed profile of when these
        documents were updated. This profile can then be correlated
        with other data sources in order to compromise the security of
        the private or password protected resources. This is one way
        adoption of SUP can potentially weaken a site's security.
