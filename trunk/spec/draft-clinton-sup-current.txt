Internet-Draft                     SUP                      January 2009


1.  Introduction

   SUP (Simple Update Protocol) consists of a notification format called
   an Updates Document (Section 3) that content publishers can use to
   alert consumers that one or more resources have been recently
   changed.  Clients can subsequently poll a single Updates Document
   rather than each underlying resource individually and thus decrease
   both the latency in discovering recent changes and the total amount
   of bandwidth and time consumed.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Design Considerations

   Updates Documents are designed to be easy for publishers to create,
   and increase in benefit as the number of underlying resources and the
   number of consumers grow.  Similarly, consumers that poll for a large
   number of resources from a given publisher, such as blog aggregators,
   feed readers, or intermediary publishers, will benefit from polling a
   publisher's Updates Document before retrieving each underlying
   resource individually.


2.  Overview

   Publishers of URI-addressable resources may associated a semi-unique
   opaque identifier, called a Resource Token (Section 4), with each
   underlying resource.  The publisher signals the existence of these
   Resource Tokens via a discovery mechanism during the retrieval of the
   resource, either within the resource itself (the Updates Link Element
   (Section 6.2)) or as meta-data associated with the response (the
   Updates Link Header (Section 6.1)).  The publisher may then create a
   URI-addressable Updates Document (Section 3) that informs consumers
   which resources, as identified by Resource Tokens, have been recently
   modified.


3.  Updates Document

   An Updates Document consists of a URI-addressable resource of type
   'application/json' containing a single top-level JSON Object
   [RFC4627], mapping a set of well-known keys to well-defined values,
   as defined below.




Buchheit & Clinton        Expires July 5, 2009                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                     SUP                      January 2009


   Consumers SHOULD ignore any unanticipated keys in the JSON dictionary
   and SHOULD continue to parse all anticipated keys as specified.

   The overall structure of the Updates Document is as follows:
   {
       "updates": [ ... ],
       "period": ...,
       "since_time": ...,
       "updated_time": ...,
       "available_periods": { ... },
   }

3.1.  The 'updates' field

   A JSON List [RFC4627] of two-element JSON Lists, each containing the
   tuple (Resource Token (Section 4), Update Token (Section 5)).

   This field is REQUIRED.  It MAY contain an empty list if no resources
   have been updated in the given interval.
   "updates": [
       ["14ea1a46", "16NV"],
       ["a2f57d4b", "16Nx"],
       ["584c7e6c", "16NV"]
   ]

3.2.  The 'period' field

   A positive integer representing the the duration of time under
   consideration in this Updates Document, in seconds.

   This field is REQUIRED.
   "period": 60

3.3.  The 'since_time' field

   An [RFC3339] formatted string representing the start time of the
   interval covered by this Updates Document.

   This field is REQUIRED.
   "since_time": "2009-01-06T00:48:38Z"

3.4.  The 'updated_time' field

   An [RFC3339] formatted string representing the end time of the
   interval covered by this Updates Document.

   This field is REQUIRED.
   "updated_time": "2009-01-06T00:50:48Z"

Internet-Draft                     SUP                      January 2009


   The delta in seconds between the 'start_time' and the 'updated_time'
   fields MUST be equal to or greater than the duration indicated by the
   'period' field.

3.5.  The 'available_periods' field

   A JSON Object mapping time periods (in seconds) to URLs where an
   additional Updates Documents of the corresponding duration may be
   found.

   This field is OPTIONAL.
   "available_periods": {
       "60": "http://example.com/sup.json?seconds=60",
       "300": "http://example.com/sup.json?seconds=300",
       "600": "http://example.com/sup.json?seconds=600"
   }


4.  Resource Token

   A Resource Token is a short opaque string used to identify a
   individual URI-addressable resource.  Each unique underlying resource
   MUST always map to a single, stable Resource Token, but different
   resources MAY occasionally share the same Resource Token.

   Consumers SHOULD NOT attempt to parse or interpret the contents of
   the Resource Token.  Clients SHOULD maintain a mapping of Resource
   Tokens to resource URIs is established via the Discovery (Section 6)
   mechanisms defined below.

   A valid Resource Token is a non-empty string of no more than 128
   characters composed of ASCII letters, numbers, or hyphens (regex
   [a-zA-Z0-9\-]), and are produced via the following rules, as defined
   by the augmented BNF [RFC5234] syntax.
   resource_token = 1*128(CHAR / DIGIT / "-")


5.  Update Token

   The Update Token is a short opaque string used to disambiguate
   distinct updates to a URI-addressable resource.  In practice, the
   last update timestamp of the resource or its ETag is a suitable
   identifier, but clients SHOULD NOT attempt to parse or interpret the
   contents of the string.

   A valid Update Token is a non-empty string of no more than 128
   characters composed of ASCII letters, numbers, or hyphens (regex
   [a-zA-Z0-9\-]), and are produced via the following rules, as defined



Buchheit & Clinton        Expires July 5, 2009                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                     SUP                      January 2009


   by the augmented BNF [RFC5234] syntax.
   update_token = 1*128(CHAR / DIGIT / "-")


6.  Discovery

   This section discusses how a publisher signals the existence of an
   Updates Document and how the publisher establishes the relationship
   between the semi-unique Resource Token and an underlying URI-
   addressable resource.

   Publishers SHOULD announce the availability of an Updates Document
   and associate the underlying resource with a corresponding Resource
   Token via the Updates Link Header (Section 6.1).  If the underlying
   resource is an XML-based document, the publisher may additionally
   include a Updates Link Element (Section 6.2) within the document
   itself.

   Use of the Updates Link Header is RECOMMENDED as it is applicable to
   all resources published over HTTP, but consumers SHOULD be prepared
   for the presence of the Updates Link Element in addition to, or
   instead of, the Updates Link Header, when the underlying resource is
   a XML-based document.

6.1.  Updates Link Header

   Responses to HTTP [RFC2616] requests for resources SHOULD include a
   HTTP Response Header [RFC2616] of 'Link' to signal both the URI at
   which the Updates Document (Section 3) may be polled and the semi-
   unique Resource Token (Section 4) of the resource being retrieved.

   The 'rel' value of the Link header is defined as follows: [Pending
   IANA consideration]
   updates

   The 'type' value of the Link header is defined as follows:
   application/json

   The 'href' value of the Link header is produced via the via the
   following rules, as defined by the augmented BNF [RFC5234] syntax,
   the URI production grammar defined in [RFC3986], and the above
   grammar defining the 'resource_token' (Section 4) production.
   updates_document_uri =
       scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" resource_token ]

   The complete value of the 'Link' header conform with the conventions
   formalized in [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header] according to the
   following production rules, as defined by the augmented BNF [RFC5234]



Buchheit & Clinton        Expires July 5, 2009                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                     SUP                      January 2009


   syntax, the URI production grammar defined in [RFC3986] and the
   'updates_document_uri' production as defined above.
   link_rel_value = "updates"
   link_type = "application/json"
   link_title = "Updates Document"
   link_header = "Link:" 1*SP updates_document_uri *SP ";" 1*LWSP
       "rel=" DQUOTE link_rel_value DQUOTE ";" 1*LWSP
       "type=" DQUOTE link_type DQUOTE ";" 1*LWSP
       "title=" DQUOTE link_title DQUOTE

   For example, the following 'Link' header refers to a Updates Document
   at 'http://example.com/sup.json' and indicates that the Resource
   Token of the resource being returned is '4496672d'.
   Link: <http://example.com/sup.json#4496672d>;
       rel="updates";
       type="application/json";
       title="Updates Document"

6.2.  Updates Link Element

   In addition to, or instead of, the Updates Link Header (Section 6.1),
   XML-based resources MAY include an Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287]
   'atom:link' element to signal both the URI at which the Updates
   Document (Section 3) may be retrieved and the Resource Token
   (Section 4) associated with the containing document.

   The 'rel' value of the atom:link element is defined as follows:
   [Pending IANA consideration]
   updates

   The 'type' value of the atom:link element is defined as follows:
   application/json

   The 'href' value of the atom:link element is produced via the via the
   following rules, as defined by the augmented BNF [RFC5234] syntax,
   the URI production grammar defined in [RFC3986], and the above
   grammar defining the 'resource_token' (Section 4) production.
   updates_document_uri =
       scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" resource_token ]

   For example, the following 'atom:link' element refers to a Updates
   Document at 'http://example.com/sup.json' and indicates that the
   Resource Token of the containing document is '4496672d'.
   <link xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
         rel="updates"
         type="application/json"
         title="Updates Document"
         href="http://example.com/sup.json#4496672d"/>

7.  Examples

   The following is a sample Updates Document that indicates that five
   distinct URI-addressable resources were updated in the interval
   between 1:14:35 and 1:16:45.
   {
     "available_periods": {
       "60": "http://example.com/sup.json?seconds=60",
       "300": "http://example.com/sup.json?seconds=300",
       "600": "http://example.com/sup.json?seconds=600"
     },
     "period": 60,
     "since_time": "2009-01-06T01:14:35Z",
     "updated_time": "2009-01-06T01:16:45Z",
     "updates": [
       [
         "4496672d",
         "16fg"
       ],
       [
         "e8d50639",
         "16fg"
       ],
       [
         "e7cd6949",
         "16eA"
       ],
       [
         "1d8274dd",
         "16eA"
       ],
       [
         "19ab3751",
         "16eA"
       ],
     ]
   }


8.  Security Considerations

   SUP does not require that a site MUST encrypt its resource tokens.
   The resource tokens may be rendered opaque through strong encryption,
   hashing, or they may be non-opaque.  In a scenario where a SUP
   document is being used to indicate that private or password protected
   resources have been updated and the resource tokens are
   insufficiently opaque (e.g. the urls of the resources are used as
   resource tokens or the resource tokens are rendered opaque with an

   algorithm that can be reversed in order to identify the underlying
   resource) then an attacker can build up a detailed profile of when
   these documents were updated.  This profile can then be correlated
   with other data sources in order to compromise the security of the
   private or password protected resources.  This is one way adoption of
   SUP can potentially weaken a site's security.


9.  IANA Considerations

   [Ed: Draft language to propose "updates" as a IANA recognized link
   relation value.]
