Internet-Draft                     SUP                      January 2009


1.  Introduction

   SUP (Simple Update Protocol) consists of a notification format that
   feed publishers can use to alert consumers that one or more content
   feeds have been recently updated.  The presence of a SUP feed allows
   for increased efficiency, and decreased latency, by reducing or
   eliminating the need for consumers to frequently poll each underlying
   feed individually.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Design Considerations

   SUP feeds are designed to be easy for publishers to create,
   increasing in benefit as the number of underlying feeds grows.
   Consumers that read a large number of feeds from a given publisher,
   such as a blog aggregators, hosted feed readers, or intermediary
   publishers, will similarly benefit most from using the SUP feed to
   reduce polling rates for individual feeds and query only when updates
   are available.


2.  Overview

   Publishers that produce large numbers of content feeds can aggregate
   a list of feeds that have changed over a given time period and
   publish this list as a SUP Feed (Section 3) to consumers.  Each
   underlying content feed is identified by an opaque token called a SUP
   ID (Section 4), which consumers can associate with a previously-seen
   feed URL, which can then be re-queried as necessary.  Publishers use
   the X-SUP-ID HTTP header (Section 6.1) and the atom:link element
   (Section 6.2) with each content feed to announce the feed's unique
   SUP ID and the location of the SUP feed itself.


3.  SUP Feed

   [Ed: Perhaps consider changing the name of this to 'Updates Feed' to
   reduce redundancy.  Also, "feed" itself might be a misleading term,
   as each new version tends to overwrite the last completely.  Perhaps
   "Updates Document" is better?]

   A SUP feed consists of a document of type 'application/json'
   containing a single top-level JSON Object [RFC4627], mapping a set of



Buchheit & Clinton        Expires July 14, 2009                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                     SUP                      January 2009


   well-known keys to well-defined values, as defined below.

   Consumers SHOULD ignore any unanticipated keys in the JSON document
   and continue to parse the expected values as intended.

   The overall structure of the SUP feed is as follows:
   {
       "updates": [ ... ],
       "period": ...,
       "since_time": ...,
       "updated_time": ...,
       "available_periods": { ... },
   }

3.1.  The 'updates' field

   A JSON List [RFC4627] of two-element JSON Lists, each containing the
   tuple (SUP ID (Section 4), Update ID (Section 5)).

   This field is REQUIRED.  It MAY contain an empty list if no content
   feeds have been updated in the given interval.
   "updates": [
       ["14ea1a46", "16NV"],
       ["a2f57d4b", "16Nx"],
       ["584c7e6c", "16NV"]
   ]

3.2.  The 'period' field

   A positive integer representing the the duration of time covered by
   this feed, in seconds.

   This field is REQUIRED.
   "period": 60

3.3.  The 'since_time' field

   An [RFC3339] formatted string representing the start time of the
   interval covered by this feed.

   This field is REQUIRED.
   "since_time": "2009-01-06T00:48:38Z"

3.4.  The 'updated_time' field

   An [RFC3339] formatted string representing the end time of the
   interval covered by this feed.

Internet-Draft                     SUP                      January 2009


   This field is REQUIRED.
   "updated_time": "2009-01-06T00:50:48Z"

   The delta in seconds between the 'start_time' and the 'updated_time'
   fields MUST be equal to or greater than the duration indicated by the
   'period' field.

3.5.  The 'available_periods' field

   A JSON Object mapping time periods (in seconds) to URLs where an
   additional SUP feed of the corresponding duration may be found.

   This field is OPTIONAL.
   "available_periods": {
       "60": "http://example.com/sup.json?seconds=60",
       "300": "http://example.com/sup.json?seconds=300",
       "600": "http://example.com/sup.json?seconds=600"
   }


4.  SUP ID

   [Ed: Perhaps consider changing this to 'Resource Id' to reduce
   redundancy.  And more generally, consider calling the underlying
   documents "resources" rather than "feeds", as the SUP technique isn't
   specific to only Atom or RSS content.]

   A SUP ID is a short opaque string used to identify a individual
   content feed.  A single feed MUST always map to a single, stable SUP
   ID, but different feeds MAY occasionally share the same SUP ID.

   Consumers SHOULD NOT attempt to parse or interpret the contents of
   the string, but instead should maintain their own mapping of SUP IDs
   to resource URIs.  The mapping of SUP ID to resource URI is
   established via the Discovery (Section 6) mechanisms defined below.

   A valid SUP ID is a non-empty string of no more than 128 characters
   composed of ASCII letters, numbers, or hyphens (regex [a-zA-Z0-9-]),
   and are produced via the following rules, as defined by the augmented
   BNF [RFC5234] syntax.
   sup_id = 1*128(CHAR / DIGIT / "-")


5.  Update ID

   [Ed: Consider changing the name of this to "Revision Id".]

   The Update ID is a short opaque string used to disambiguate distinct



Buchheit & Clinton        Expires July 14, 2009                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                     SUP                      January 2009


   updates to a content feed.  In practice, the last update timestamp of
   the content feed is a suitable identifier, but clients SHOULD NOT
   attempt to parse or intepret the contents of the string.

   A valid Update ID is a non-empty string of no more than 128
   characters composed of ASCII letters, numbers, or hyphens (regex
   [a-zA-Z0-9-]), and are produced via the following rules, as defined
   by the augmented BNF [RFC5234] syntax.
   update_id = 1*128(CHAR / DIGIT / "-")


6.  Discovery

   This section discusses how a publisher signals the existence of SUP
   feed.

   Feeds SHOULD announce the availabilty of by setting the 'X-SUP-ID'
   HTTP header (Section 6.1), and/or by including a 'atom:link' element
   (Section 6.2), or both.

   Use of the 'X-SUP-ID' HTTP header is RECOMMENDED since it works for
   feed types, but feed consumers SHOULD be prepared for the presence of
   the link element in addition to, or instead of, the X-SUP-ID header.

6.1.  'X-SUP-ID' HTTP header

   Responses to HTTP [RFC2616] requests for content feeds SHOULD include
   a HTTP Response Header [RFC2616] of 'X-SUP-ID' to signal both the URI
   at which the SUP feed (Section 3) may be polled and the SUP ID
   (Section 4) of the underlying content feed.

   Valid 'X-SUP-ID' headers are produced via the following rules, as
   defined by the augmented BNF [RFC5234] syntax, the URI production
   grammar defined in [RFC3986], and the above grammar defining the
   'sup_id' (Section 4) production.
   x_sup_id_header   = "X-SUP-ID" ":" 1*SP updates_uri
   updates_uri       = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" sup_id ]

   For example, the following 'X-SUP-ID' header refers to a SUP Feed at
   'http://example.com/sup.json' and indicates that the SUP ID of the
   resource being returned is '4496672d'.
   X-SUP-ID: http://example.com/sup.json#4496672d

6.2.  atom:link Element

   In addition to, or instead of, the 'X-SUP-ID' HTTP header
   (Section 6.1), XML-based resources MAY include the Atom Syndication
   Format [RFC4287] 'atom:link' element to signal both the URI at which



Buchheit & Clinton        Expires July 14, 2009                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                     SUP                      January 2009


   the SUP feed (Section 3) may be polled and the SUP ID (Section 4) of
   the underlying content feed.

   The 'rel' value of the atom:link element is defined as follows: [Ed:
   This should change.  See IANA Considerations below.]
   http://api.friendfeed.com/2008/03#sup

   The 'type' value of the atom:link element is defined as follows:
   application/json

   The 'href' value of the atom:link element is produced via the via the
   following rules, as defined by the augmented BNF [RFC5234] syntax,
   the URI production grammar defined in [RFC3986], and the above
   grammar defining the 'sup_id' (Section 4) production.
   updates_uri = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" sup_id ]

   For example, the following 'atom:link' refers to a SUP feed at
   'http://example.com/sup.json' and indicates that the SUP ID of the
   feed itself is '4496672d'.
   <link xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
         rel="http://api.friendfeed.com/2008/03#sup"
         type="application/json"
         title="Updates Feed"
         href="http://example.com/sup.json#4496672d"/>

6.3.  HTTP 'Link' header [Ed: proposed]

   [Ed: Perhaps HTTP Link headers, as formalized in
   [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header], could be used instead of, or in
   addition to, the one-off X-SUP-ID header.  For example, the following
   conveys the same information in a more standardized manner, and is
   more consistent with the 'atom:link' entry in the feed itself.]
   Link: <http://example.com/sup.json#276b6c46>;
       rel="http://api.friendfeed.com/2008/03#sup";
       type="application/json";
       title="Updates Feed"


7.  Examples

   A SUP feed indicating that five content feeds were updated in the
   interval between 1:14:35 and 1:16:45.

8.  Security Considerations

   [Ed: Address any known security concerns here, with an emphasis on
   documenting real risks to either publishers or consumers.]


9.  IANA Considerations

   [Ed: Document a proposed permanent link relation value here (instead
   of "http://api.friendfeed.com/2008/03#sup").  Perhaps "updates"?]
